Changes since ZNC 1.2

This release is done to fix a denial of service attack through webadmin. After authentication, users can crash ZNC through a use-after-delete.
Additionally, a number of fixes and nice, low-risk additions from our development branch is included.

In detail, these are:


New
===

* Reduce users' confusion during --makeconf.
* Warn people that making ZNC listen on port 6667 might cause problems with some web browsers.
* Always generate a SSL certificate during --makeconf.
* Stop asking for a bind host / listen host in --makeconf. People who don't want wildcard binds can configure this later.
* Don't create ~/.znc/modules if it doesn't exist yet.


Fixes
=====

* Fix a use-after-delete in webadmin.
* Honor the BindHost whitelist when configuring BindHosts in controlpanel module.
* Ignore trailing whitespace in <code>/znc jump</code> arguments.
* Change formatting of startup messages so that we never overwrite part of a message when printing the result of an action.
* Fix configure on non-bash shells.
* Send the correct error for invalid CAP subcommands.
* Make sure znc-buildmod includes zncconfig.h at the beginning of module code.


Modules
=======

* Make awaystore automatically call the Ping command when the Back command is used.
* Add SSL information and port number to servers in network list in webadmin.

Internal
========
